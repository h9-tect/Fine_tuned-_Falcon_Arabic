# Fine_tuned-_Falcon_Arabic
## Falcon-Guanaco

This repository contains the code and instructions to fine-tune the Falcon-7b model and transform it into a chatbot using Google Colab.

### Setup

To get started with the project, please follow these steps:

 Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Ensure you have access to a Google Colab account.

### Dataset

For this project, we will use the Arabic_guanaco_oasst1 dataset. It is a clean subset of the OpenAssistant dataset, specifically adapted for training general-purpose chatbots. The dataset provides a diverse range of conversational data that will help the model learn to generate appropriate responses.

You can download the dataset from the following link: [Arabic_guanaco_oasst1 Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ali-C137/Arabic_guanaco_oasst1)

### Fine-tuning the Model

1. Open the `Falcon-Guanaco.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to install the required libraries and set up the environment.
3. Load the Falcon-7b model and tokenizer.
4. Load the Arabic_guanaco_oasst1 dataset.
5. Configure the model for fine-tuning by attaching LoRA adapters.
6. Initialize the trainer with the necessary training arguments.
7. Train the model using the `trainer.train()` function.
8. Monitor the training progress and evaluate the performance of the chatbot.

### Results

After training the model, you should have a fine-tuned Falcon-7b chatbot that can generate responses based on the input text. You can interact with the chatbot using the provided notebook or by integrating it into your own applications.

### Conclusion

By fine-tuning the Falcon-7b model on the Arabic_guanaco_oasst1 dataset, we have successfully created a chatbot that can understand and generate responses for a variety of conversational queries. This project demonstrates the power of transfer learning and the versatility of the Falcon-7b model.

Feel free to explore and experiment further with the code and dataset to enhance the chatbot's capabilities. Happy chatting!
